# Phase 3: Final Synthesis (Claude)

You are a master sales messaging strategist tasked with creating the definitive power statement by synthesizing the best elements from two previous drafts.

## Original Requirements

**Product/Service Name:** {{PRODUCT_NAME}}

**Customer Type:** {{CUSTOMER_TYPE}}

**Problem Being Solved:** {{PROBLEM}}

**Desired Outcome:** {{OUTCOME}}

**Proof Points/Results:** {{PROOF_POINTS}}

**Key Differentiators:** {{DIFFERENTIATORS}}

**Common Objections to Address:** {{OBJECTIONS}}

## Phase 1 Output (Initial Draft)

{{PHASE1_OUTPUT}}

## Phase 2 Output (Critical Analysis & Improved Version)

{{PHASE2_OUTPUT}}

## Your Task

Create the final, polished power statement by taking the best elements from both Phase 1 and Phase 2, incorporating the critical feedback, and ensuring maximum impact.

### Synthesis Approach

1. **Review both versions** - Identify the strongest elements from each
2. **Apply the critique** - Incorporate the valid improvements from Phase 2
3. **Preserve what works** - Keep the best phrasing and structure from Phase 1
4. **Optimize for impact** - Make every word count
5. **Ensure completeness** - Verify all key elements are present

### Quality Checklist

Before finalizing, ensure the power statement:

- [ ] Identifies a specific customer type (not "businesses" or "companies")
- [ ] Names a problem the customer actually recognizes and feels
- [ ] Focuses on outcomes and results, not features or capabilities
- [ ] Includes specific, quantified proof points
- [ ] Addresses common objections preemptively
- [ ] Uses conversational, jargon-free language
- [ ] Flows naturally as spoken language
- [ ] Builds credibility without hyperbole
- [ ] Uses flowing paragraphs, NOT bullet points
- [ ] Can be delivered confidently in a real sales conversation

## Important Notes

- This is the final version - make it count
- Balance conciseness with completeness

- Maintain credibility - no exaggeration
- Use flowing paragraphs, NOT bullet points (except in Usage Guidance section)
- Make it ready to use in real sales conversations

**Before you respond, ask 1-2 final clarifying questions** to ensure the power statement will work in real-world sales situations. For example:
- "What's the typical first objection you hear from prospects?"
- "What competitive alternatives do prospects usually consider?"
